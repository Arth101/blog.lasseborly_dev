A 24 year old guy situated just outside of Copenhagen.

I just finished my AP degree in Computer Science at KEA and have jumped straight into the top-up, Software Development.
During my AP degree I studied half a year at University of Westminster in the heart of London.
Besides Software Development I spend my time teaching in the physical arts of parkour two times a week and on fridays I love experiencing some of the many micro breweries that have been sprouting up around copenhagen these last few years.
