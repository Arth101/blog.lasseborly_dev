Guys some stuff has happened since last.
<!--more-->
I have got a job at a small
consultant business and after i graduated form my PBA I was asked if I wanted to
teach programming for a bit. I though why not and jumped on the opportunity. So
here I am, teaching Java programming to an international class two times a week
and consulting the rest of the week.

Life is pretty great.
