      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a lot of developers from my generation I started out on the web. The web revolution was upon us and nothing could stop it. We desperately needed tools to work the web and make it our common home. &lt;strong&gt;The blogging began.&lt;/strong&gt;But setting up a blog wasn&amp;rsquo;t at first easy. It required some form of development knowledge and more people from different styles of life wanted to join in on the blogging. One of those people was &lt;a href=&#34;http://ma.tt/about/&#34;&gt;Matthew Charles Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt;. A freshman at university. In 2001 b2/cafelog launches as a PHP blogging tool and in 2003 Matthew Charles Mullenweg forks it and creates the first version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://codex.wordpress.org/History&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. The soon to be giga CMS that now runs about &lt;a href=&#34;http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all&#34;&gt;23% of the worlds websites&lt;/a&gt;.Soon the blogging was about to end and a fully fledged CMS would take it&amp;rsquo;s place.But was that the intent? Did people want to serve anything else than blog posts? 23% of the internet seems to agree. But then some don&amp;rsquo;t. A friend and I talked about how software can warp and mutate into something it was never intended to be. How it can take on features and functions that was never a part of the original scope. Is it necessary with plugins if you want to convey a message? Is static pages a must when trying to get a discussion going?I would say no. WordPress evolved into something different.Something not needed for blogging.Most often &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep&#34;&gt;feature creep&lt;/a&gt; is thought of as negative and in the sense of blogging platforms I tend to agree. The topic and content of the post should be the focus and instead you are provided with a bunch of features and functionality that complicates and burdens the CMS to the brink of it being a 200kg guy walking on a treadmill at the speed of 2km/h.If you stop the treadmill/development and admit your feature creep and your shaky foundation the big guy will fall to his knees and if you keep him going and keep feature creeping/feeding him he won&amp;rsquo;t get any slimmer or faster. This rant spawns from I was very close to committing the same sin. I just found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost&#34;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;. The piece of software that my blog runs on now and thought to myself, \&amp;ldquo;huh this is neat. Could I move my main website to this CMS.\&amp;ldquo;.I had already planned out how I would implement static pages and a plugin function when it occurred to me I was close to repeat history and it&amp;rsquo;s mistakes.Sometimes things need to be simple to be effective and to fulfill their purpose. Not needing to evolve and mutate into something monstrous.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The $ in jQuery</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, I have been using jQuery for the last two years and even had a lecturer (&lt;a href=&#34;https://jquery.org/team/&#34;&gt;Anne-Gaelle Colom&lt;/a&gt;) which is one of the few team members of jQuery.What I&amp;rsquo;m about to tell you I did not know. I have used jQuery in periods on a daily basis for almost two years and this never occurred to me.The &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; in jQuery is the same as writing &lt;code&gt;jQuery&lt;/code&gt;.Instead of writing &lt;code&gt;jQuery.isNumeric(&#39;420&#39;);&lt;/code&gt;You can use the shorthand way and write &lt;code&gt;$.isNumeric(&#39;420&#39;);&lt;/code&gt;.I thank &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.martinbytes.com/&#34;&gt;Martin Graversen&lt;/a&gt; for the realization and wonder why I never caught onto that myself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A 24 year young stallion situated just outside of Copenhagen.I just finished my AP degree in Computer Science at KEA and have jumped straight into the top-up, Software Development. During my AP degree I studied half a year at University of Westminster in the heart of London.Besides software development I spend my time teaching in the physical arts of parkour two times a week and on fridays I love experiencing some of the many micro breweries that have been sprouting up around copenhagen these last few years.So&lt;code&gt;this.me = you;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
