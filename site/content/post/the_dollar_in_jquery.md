Ok, I have been using jQuery for the last two years and even had a lecturer ([Anne-Gaelle Colom](https://jquery.org/team/)) which is one of the few team members of jQuery.What I'm about to tell you I did not know. I have used jQuery in periods on a daily basis for almost two years and this never occurred to me.The `$` in jQuery is the same as writing `jQuery`.Instead of writing `jQuery.isNumeric('420');`You can use the shorthand way and write `$.isNumeric('420');`.I thank [Martin Graversen](http://blog.martinbytes.com/) for the realization and wonder why I never caught onto that myself.
